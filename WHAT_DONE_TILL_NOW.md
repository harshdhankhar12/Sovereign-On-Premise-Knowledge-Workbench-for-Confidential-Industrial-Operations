# Completed Features

### 1. Document Intelligence and Local Vector Retrieval Engine
Allows plant engineers to upload confidential refinery Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), equipment vendor manuals, and inspection logs for instant offline search.

* **Page-Aware PDF Ingestion:** Parses technical documents page-by-page and extracts clean text while preserving exact page numbers for 1-click verification.
* **Cryptographic Deduplication:** Uses SHA-256 file hashing to immediately identify previously uploaded files, saving storage space and avoiding duplicate processing.
* **Local AI Embeddings:** Converts document text into 768-dimensional mathematical concepts using `nomic-embed-text` running locally through Ollama with zero internet dependency.
* **Sub-Millisecond Semantic Search:** Searches document chunks in PostgreSQL using pgvector and HNSW indexing, allowing engineers to ask questions in plain English and retrieve exact procedure steps.
* **Exact Source Citations:** Every search result returns the specific document title, page number, and similarity confidence score so engineers never receive unverified or hallucinated information.
